## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Firebase project (for data migration)

## Environment Setup

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure the following environment variables:

- **PostgreSQL**:

  - `POSTGRES_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
  - `POSTGRES_SSL`: Set to `true` if SSL is required

- **AWS**:

  - `AWS_REGION`: AWS region (e.g., us-east-1)
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret access key
  - `AWS_S3_BUCKET`: S3 bucket name for media storage

- **API Keys**:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for AI features
  - `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`: Optional for alternative image generation

## Database Setup

1. Create a PostgreSQL database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE lumeo_db;
```

2. Run the migration script to create tables:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d lumeo_db -f migrations/create_tables.sql
```

## Data Migration

To migrate existing data from Firebase to PostgreSQL:

1. Export your Firebase service account credentials:

   - Go to Firebase console > Project settings > Service accounts
   - Click "Generate new private key" and save as `firebase-credentials.json` in the project root

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install pg pg-format firebase-admin dotenv
```

3. Run the migration script:

```bash
node scripts/migrate-firebase-to-postgres.js
```

## AWS Infrastructure Setup

1. Set up an S3 bucket for media storage:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://lumeo-assets --region <your-region>
```

2. Configure bucket permissions:

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket lumeo-assets --policy file://aws/bucket-policy.json
```

3. Create CloudFront distribution for the S3 bucket (optional but recommended)

## Running the Application

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Install server dependencies:

```bash
./setup-server.sh
```

3. Start both server and client in development mode:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

4. Alternatively, start just the server:

```bash
npm run server:dev
```

5. Or just the client:

```bash
npm run client:dev
```
